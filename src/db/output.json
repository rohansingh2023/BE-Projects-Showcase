It seeks to develop an automated system capable of accurately analyzing text-based content across online platforms to detect instances of cyberbullying.\n\nLeveraging a dataset of approximately 110,000 instances, the study explores various detection methods, including non-deep learning approaches such as SVM, L2 regularization, and random forest, as well as deep learning techniques utilizing BERT. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach combining BERT and LSTM is planned.\n\nThe classification system categorizes tweets into six major categories: gender, age, religion, not cyberbullying, and ethnicity. To evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, a test dataset of 20,000 tweets will be employed, facilitating a comparative analysis to determine which model best identifies and classifies cyberbullying tweets accurately.",

Businesses like AbCoffee are constantly seeking ways to expand their footprint and capture new markets, but the process of selecting an ideal location can be daunting. Traditional methods of site selection often rely on intuition or anecdotal evidence, leading to suboptimal decisions and potentially costly mistakes.\n\nTo address this challenge, our project undertakes a data-driven approach to spatial analysis, leveraging the power of data science techniques to identify optimal locations for coffee shop expansion in Mumbai. By harnessing comprehensive datasets encompassing cafe locations, real estate pricing, and transportation accessibility, we aim to provide businesses with actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.\n\nThe heart of our approach lies in clustering analysis, specifically employing the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. This algorithm allows us to identify clusters of cafes based on geographic proximity, enabling us to understand patterns of cafe distribution across the city. By analyzing the characteristics of these clusters, such as cafe density, variety, and proximity to transportation hubs, we gain valuable insights into the underlying factors driving the success of existing coffee outlets.\n\nMoreover, our analysis extends beyond cafe locations to encompass broader market dynamics, including real estate pricing and transportation accessibility. By integrating data on property prices per square foot across different localities in Mumbai and assessing the proximity of cafe clusters to train stations and other transportation hubs, we gain a comprehensive understanding of the market landscape.\n\nOne of the key advantages of our approach is its scalability and adaptability. While our initial focus is on coffee shop expansion in Mumbai, the methodology and techniques employed can be applied to other cities and regions with minimal modifications. This scalability not only enhances the generalizability of our findings but also allows businesses to replicate our approach in diverse market environments.\n\nThe recommendations generated by our analysis provide businesses like AbCoffee with actionable insights to support their expansion efforts. By identifying potential locations with high business potential and minimal competition, businesses can minimize risks and maximize their chances of success in a competitive market landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, our project represents a powerful application of data science techniques to support strategic decision-making in coffee shop expansion. By harnessing the power of data, we empower businesses to make informed decisions, seize opportunities for growth, and thrive in dynamic market environments.",

Regional languages frequently face issues such as a lack of digital material, resource constraints, linguistic inflections, and structural variance. This work attempts to fill up those similar gaps so that we can model text summarizers in regional languages. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of self-attention mechanisms for abstractive text summarization in two Indo-Aryan languages, Gujarati and Hindi, by particularly utilizing a Conventional Transformer. Our methodology entails using the ILSUM dataset to train a specially constructed Transformer model. Articles, headlines, and summaries are used to curate corpora for the Indian Language Summarization project (ILSUM).",

This technology holds significant potential for various applications, including improving speech recognition accuracy in noisy environments, aiding individuals with hearing impairments, enhancing human-computer interaction in multimedia systems, and facilitating automatic transcription of videos. The first step involves preprocessing the video data to extract relevant visual features. This typically involves techniques such as face detection and tracking, lip region segmentation, and feature extraction. Common features include lip movements, facial expressions, and head gestures. LipNet is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for lip reading. It combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from lip images with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence modeling and prediction.STCNNs are specialized architectures designed to capture both spatial and temporal information from video data. They typically consist of 3D convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers for classification or prediction tasks. Bi-LSTMs are recurrent neural networks that process input sequences in both forward and backward directions, enabling them to capture temporal dependencies effectively. They are often used for sequence modeling tasks such as speech recognition and natural languageprocessing. Once the architecture is selected, the model is trained using labeled video data, where the input consists of visual features extracted from video frames, and the output is the corresponding speech content. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize prediction errors using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive optimization algorithms like Adam. After training, the model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, qualitative assessment through visual inspection of predictions can provide insights into the model&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. Once the model is trained and evaluated satisfactorily, it can be deployed for real-world applications. These applications may include real-time speech recognition in videos, automatic transcription of spoken content, enhancing accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments, and integrating with multimedia systems for interactive experiences. Overall, visual speech recognition using deep learning holds promise for advancing the state-of-the-art in speech processing and multimedia technology, with potential benefits across various domains.\n",

However, the complexity and \"black-box\" nature of neural networks often pose challenges in understanding their decision-making processes, hindering their widespread adoption in critical applications. To address this challenge, our project aims to demystify neural networks using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques.\n\nProject Description:\n\nOur project focuses on creating a transparent understanding of neural networks by leveraging a combination of techniques, including autoencoder architectures, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for time-series data analysis, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretation, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for intuitive explanation generation.\n\n1. Autoencoder Setup with TCN:\n\nWe begin by constructing an autoencoder architecture tailored for the specific task of analyzing time-series data with 51 feature attributes. Autoencoders are neural networks trained to reconstruct input data, thus learning a compressed representation of the input. We integrate Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) within the autoencoder setup to effectively capture temporal dependencies in the time-series data. TCNs are renowned for their ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently, making them suitable for processing sequential data.\n\n2. SHAP Analysis:\n\nOnce the autoencoder with TCN is trained on the dataset, we employ (SHapley Additive exPlanations) SHAP values to understand the importance of each feature attribute in the model&#39;s decision-making process. SHAP provides a coherent explanation of individual predictions by quantifying the impact of each feature on the model&#39;s output. By visualizing SHAP values, users gain insights into how different features influence the neural network&#39;s decisions, enhancing transparency and interpretability.\n\n3. NLP-Based Explanation Generation:\n\nTo further enhance the interpretability of the neural network&#39;s decisions, we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate human-readable explanations. By analyzing the learned representations and SHAP values, we extract key insights and transform them into intuitive explanations in natural language. These explanations provide users with actionable insights into the model&#39;s behavior, enabling informed decision-making.\n\nExpected Outcome:\n\nThrough our project, we aim to achieve the following outcomes:\n\nEnhanced Understanding: Provide users with a clear understanding of how neural networks operate, particularly in the context of time-series data analysis with multiple features.\nTransparency: Offer transparent insights into the decision-making process of the neural network, facilitating trust and confidence in its predictions.\nAccessibility: Make complex neural network models accessible to a wider audience by presenting explanations in a comprehensible and intuitive manner.\nPractical Utility: Enable stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the insights gleaned from the explainable AI techniques employed in the project.",
